ezSyntax
=================
Hi, welcome to the ezSyntax page on GitHub. With ezSyntax, you can easily add syntax highlighting to your `<code>` blocks using one line of code.


Need help? [Join the Discord](https://willm.xyz/discord)!


Check out more info on [ezsyntax.willm.xyz](https://ezsyntax.willm.xyz) \ ゜o゜)ノ

If you find a bug or something not working right, **please** [submit an issue](https://github.com/whasonyt/ezsyntax/issues/new)!

-----------------------
## To-Do 
- [ ] Allow users to change which programming language gets syntaxed (only HTML right now)
- [ ] Instead of having to use `syntax('demo', 1)`, have an option to apply to all `<code>` blocks

> Submit a pull request if you'd like to contribute any of these features!
