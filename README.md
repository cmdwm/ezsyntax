=================
Hi, welcome to the ezSyntax page on GitHub. With ezSyntax, you can easily add syntax highlighting to your `<code>` blocks using one line of code.

-----------------------
## To-Do 
- [ ] Allow users to change which programming language gets syntaxed (only HTML right now)
- [ ] Instead of having to use `syntax('demo', 1)`, have an option to apply to all `<code>` blocks
